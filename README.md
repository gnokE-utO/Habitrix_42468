This is a smart productivity web application designed to help users stay focused by monitoring browsing activity and guiding them back to task-relevant content. 
The app integrates with a browser extension (not included in this repo) to detect distractions (e.g., watching unrelated YouTube videos), logs off-task behavior, and can redirect or block distracting websites in real-time.
Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend) and PHP + MySQL (Backend) , this project offers a lightweight and customizable solution for personal time management and digital focus improvement.

Frontend : HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
Backend : PHP 8+
Database : MySQLite
Optional : XAMPP / WAMP / MAMP for local development
